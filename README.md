## Divvy Bike Share Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project analyzes Divvy BikeShare trip data to understand the different usage patterns between annual members and casual riders.
The insights gained can inform business strategies for optimizing operations,membership, marketing, and user engagement.

## Business Question
How do members and casual riders use Divvy bikes differently?

## Data Source
The analysis is based on Divvy BikeShare trip data (CSV files) for the period of January 2024 to December 2024. It is gotten from https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html.
